Import required modules − We use the require directive to load Node.js modules.

Create server − 
    A server which will listen to client's requests similar to Apache HTTP Server.

Read request and return response − 
    The server created in an earlier step will read the HTTP request made by the 
    client which can be a browser or a console and return the response.

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment 
like a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell where a command is entered and the 
system responds with an output in an interactive mode. Node.js or Node comes bundled 
with a REPL environment. It performs the following tasks −

Read − Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.

Eval − Takes and evaluates the data structure.

Print − Prints the result.

Loop − Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice.

REPL Commands
ctrl + c − terminate the current command.

ctrl + c twice − terminate the Node REPL.

ctrl + d − terminate the Node REPL.

Up/Down Keys − see command history and modify previous commands.

tab Keys − list of current commands.

.help − list of all commands.

.break − exit from multiline expression.

.clear − exit from multiline expression.

.save filename − save the current Node REPL session to a file.

.load filename − load file content in current Node REPL session.

Stopping REPL
As mentioned above, you will need to use ctrl-c twice to come out of Node.js REPL.

$ node
>
(^C again to quit)

Installing Modules using NPM
There is a simple syntax to install any Node.js module −

$ npm install <Module Name>
